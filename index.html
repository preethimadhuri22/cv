          <i>  Am just a simple woman who always makes things complicated in life.
            <br/>


            i love exploring things but am unable to do it because am afraid that i
            might be judged for things. <br/>

          i show to others that i don't care but deep
            inside am cared about it. <br/>

          i always try to be myself and more expressive
            but i always endup in doing other way.
            <br/>

           i don't have much confidence about
            myself.<br/>


             my near people can easily find it with my behaviour.this is just
            a breif about me. <br/>
